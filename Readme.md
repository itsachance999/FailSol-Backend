## Idea

Mostly 75% transation is failing nowadays in solana network so founder is required platform  allow user to mint the NFT  of the failed transation.

## Workflow

Once user go to the platoform and click mint button, it called specific endpoint and the endpoint will find new failed transaction and make Image with the information like signature, fee, timestamp, signer, etc.

And then it upload the image to IPFS and get the hash url ,next make metadata and upload to IPFS like pinata, so user can mint the NFT and owned his wallet.

There are several feature, mint and gift , can mint specific signature user want to mint, using the Metaplex, Umi.
